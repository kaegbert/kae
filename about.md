 <p>

My name is Kevin and I am interested in effective communication and our changing relationships with emergent technologies.</p>

<p>I was born in Rochester, grew up in Saratoga Springs, and now live in New York. I currently study New Media at Purchase College. I graduated from SUNY Adirondack with an AAS in Media Arts in 2014. My creative background is heavily tied to my fascination with computers and love for sound and music.</p>
