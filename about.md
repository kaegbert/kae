Kevin Egbert is a New York born artist, musician, and maker. His work intersects art, communication, and electronics, addressing communication noise by using digital electronics and analog media forms as metaphor for interpersonal communication. Chance based video work, site specific installations, experimental sonic compositions, and still print media are forms used to explore the rifts and relationships of media platforms and interfaces. He is currently a digital photo editor in Queensbury, New York and lives and works in Saratoga Springs. Kevin graduated from SUNY Adirondack with an AAS in Media Arts in 2014 before graduating magna cum laude from Purchase College at the State University of New York in Purchase, New York in 2017 with a BA in New Media.
