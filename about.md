I am interested in relationships between digital and analog technologies as well as relationships made between humans and the world around us.

I am interested in interactivity, our relationship with technology. They spark the creativity to make us better people and a better society. As an experience designer and media strategist, I will get you doing and discovering things you might not otherwise. I’m often at the helm of a fair bit of creative chaos, be it with a film collective of AIDS orphans in Ethiopia or a punk rock video game gallery in New York City. I bring on order for the sake of greater stability and impact. My creative roots lie in documentary photography, and my current work involves games and real world adventures.


“showing up for today’s programming.” When do we become aware of the environment around us and be active, rather than passively consume?

  I have experience in using microcontrollers and am interested in human interface design.

 raises questions surrounding our awareness to the sounds we experience around us as well as to who has access or the ability to experience more popular video games.

 I think an audio game could create platform for conversation surrounding these relationships. What if another user described the space the other was trying to navigate? We are surrounded by remote communication but what if each party is deprived of a sense?

 I think it is important to see be aware of how we use language and what these words are really meant to portray. We all inherently are subject to noise of all of forms that affect our ability to meaningfully communicate. I think by using the technology we can connect to others ideas and one could "orient" themselves and become aware of where they stand (physically/virtually) in relation to the information communicated.</h3> -->
