Three fundamental breaks in music notation in all of western music history.

*Monody to Polyphony around 900 A.D.*

1. Neumatic pitch notation became obsolete, replaced by intervallic staff notation.

2. Specificity of duration introduced: mensural notation.

"After a few centuries, early Polyphony challenged by chords and chord progressions... Around 1400-1500 perfect balance of horizontal and vertical forces achieved; but around 1600 chordal harmony became an independent force capable of dominating linear elements that previously reigned supreme." - Kurt Stone

*Partbooks superceded by score notation*

"...Because a score shows all parts unerneath eachother, enables the reader to follow not only horizontal (melodic, linear) aspects of composition, but also vertical (harmonic) ones." - Kurt Stone

*Third Stylistic Upheaval*

1950's

Two sharply contrasting directions:

1. Unprecedented increase in precision of every conceivable component of a musical texture, with particular emphasis on formerly subsidiary elements such as dynamics, timbre, pitch inflections (microtones), location of sound sources... Also went far beyond traditonal note values (1,2,4,8,16...) with arithmetical (1,2,3,4,5) note values.

2. Rejected precision, introduced deliberate ambiguity, varying degrees of indeterminancy, choices between alternatives, improvisation, utilization of extraneous, unpredictable sounds and circumstances... abandonment of traditional notation in favor of "implicit graphics." - such graphics assure greatest possible imagination and ingenuity.


"Musical notation, after all, is not an ideal method of communication, utilizing, as it does, visual devices to express aural concepts. But it is all we have." - Kurt Stone
