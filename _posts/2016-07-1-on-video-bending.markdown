There is something inherently physical about video tape. How it looks and definitely how it *feels*. Mostly forgotten or considered obsolete, there is no doubt that it lacks the clarity and convenience of digital video. We use digital recording technologies everyday. Most likely, on our phones. What I am writing does not intend to critique or detail specific past uses of these technologies in relation to video art but to raise question around our relationship to them and how might "ancient" analog and emergent digital technologies relate. I am more specifically talking about video generated from the hacking, circuit-bending, and altering of composite video signal generating hardware with out the aid of a digital computer.

 there is an outrageous amount of digital video rendered each day. We claim to know the strengths of it yet most of the time we barely break the surface of its capabilities.
