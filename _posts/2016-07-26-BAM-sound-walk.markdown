<p>In late July I volunteered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, assisting with a summer digital media and electronics camp for elementary students.
</p>
<p>The first Digital Arts Studio ran from July 18th to July 22nd and worked with students ranging from the age of eight to nine. The second session ran from the 25th to the 29th and worked with students from ages ten to eleven.
</p>
<p>
BAM, which is located in downtown Brooklyn, has been open and operating since 1908. The academy is known for is progressive and avant garde performances. While also operating as a large scale performance center, BAM has focused on urban arts and community needs, including workshops and classes for students.
</p>
<p>
Students worked on group as well as individual projects ranging from building drawing robots to creating sound maps. The maps were made out of common craft materials but interfaced with a Makey-makey controller, allowing users to touch specific locations on the map and trigger audio of field recordings that students recorded during a walk through downtown Brooklyn.
</p>
<p>
Digital Arts Studio at BAM was in partnership with The School for Poetic Computation, an artist-led school for beginners and professionals exploring the creative use of software, hardware, and theory.

<!-- In partnership with The School for Poetic Computation in collaboration with Molmol Kuo

Like paint or words, electronics and source code can be used as tools to create new works of art and poetry. This truly inventive workshop expands students’ understanding of the artistic process by demonstrating how electronics can be integrated into art. Activities include learning the basics of electricity, incorporate drawing and code, build a handmade computer, and create an audio landscape of the BAM neighborhood with noise and sound.

PARTICIPANTS WILL:
• Develop abstract reasoning skills
• Develop logical thinking and analytical research
