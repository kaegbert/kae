I am deciding to treat this site more like a blog then a portfolio. I am hoping by contributing each day I can grow as developer and get into a specific, specialized workflow.
I just began using a web based application called Hours. I am hoping will keep me more conscientious of my time. Lets see if it sticks.

To truly know something you have to be able to teach it. I am hoping by making small tutorials it will help me commit this to memory.


I have put off learning vim for a really long time and I just don't know why. I am tired of not knowing how to use it, especially when pulling from github.

Anyways, from the terminal type ```vi``` to enter vim.
