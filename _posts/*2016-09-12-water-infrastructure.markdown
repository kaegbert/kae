*Water Infrastructure Research and Questions*


After visiting and documenting locations on campus related to Purchase's water supply, Kim and I looked at a proposal that details information surrounding the Senior Housing on the campus. The proposal outlines water supply, sewer, and stormwater management systems.

In regards to the water supply, Purchase's supply is provided by Westchester Joint Water Works who obtains water from Catskill and Delaware watersheds of New York City and also from Rye lake. The Waterworks is in negotiations with Westchester County about construction of a new water treatment plant in which it is not know if it impact college tuition rates. There is over 200,000 gallons of water used per day and hydrant flow tests indicate that there is sufficient fire flow except for the furthest ends of water main system.

Sewer service is owned and maintained by SUNY and the system is connected to a sewer that lies along the eastern boundary of the campus near Blind Brook. There is estimated 113,000 gallons of sewage per day that flows from the sewage system.

The stormwater system is in the southwestern area of campus. The site drains to tributaries of Blind Brook which flows through Rye and Harrison to Milton Harbor.

After reading through the proposal I reached out to a former New Media student, Danny Fabricant, who worked on a storm drain sensor system in Steve Lambert's Special Project in Tiny Computing class. Danny worked with Professor Ryan Taylor to create a system using Raspberry Pi to measure storm drain water levels. I reached out to Danny who detailed information as to a pond marked with orange plastic ties that leads to a pond where the project takes place. I have since then reached out to Ryan Taylor in hopes of gaining more information about the stormwater system.
