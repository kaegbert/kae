*Week 1 Reading Response*

Shannon Mattern's Infrasture Tourism is insightful look at how we can create projects that empower users or participants to analyze infrastructure. She details a trip where she "visited the internet" by traveling around Lower Manhattan and looking at where network server's physically exist. She talks about how wirelessness may arguably create more wires than anything, at that the feeling of being wireless is really an illusion. She uses this example as a jumping off point as to how we can start reconsidering our relationship to large scale infrastructure.

Shes goes on to explain how mapping infrastructure can dramatically inform how we design cities, manage resources, and network with each other. She cites Lisa Parks in saying that "it is our duty to be aware of systems that surround us." I think this is extremely important and typically goes unnoticed.

Despite some criticism to how some art projects may not yield any real answers to the problems they seek to expose, Mattern explains that these projects can cause people to be more self-reflexive, which could lead to large scale changes as a population.
