*Week 1 Reading Response*
*Jedediah Purdy, 2015, Anthropocene Fever*

Purdy's Anthropocene Fever looks at how we have entered a new epoch, that of the Anthropocene, or a time defined by human activity. Recently "geological layers are marked by human chemicals and industrial waste, the pollens of crops we grow, the absence of extinct species." To reiterate, human activity has become the direct driver of global change.

Because of this, Purdy and other writers argue that the contrast between people and nature "no longer holds." Purdy quotes Dipesh Charabarty who said that the new epoch "requires a new paradigm of thought, a 'negative universal history'." He concludes stating that the world people will get to inhabit will only be the one they make and argues that this is critical to the development of new political and institutional programs.

I think this reading was a really interesting perspective to look at right in the start to this course. Before reading, I was not aware of this idea, the idea of a new epoch. The first step in progress is recognition of a problem. Rather than continuing to romanticize or mysticize our relationship to nature we have to recognize that we are apart of it, and our actions directly effect the world we inhabit.

*Shannon Mattern, 2014 Infrasture Tourism*

Shannon Mattern's Infrasture Tourism is insightful look at how we can create projects that empower users or participants to analyze infrastructure. She details a trip where she "visited the internet" by traveling around Lower Manhattan and looking at where network server's physically exist. She talks about how wirelessness may arguably create more wires than anything, and that the feeling of being wireless is really an illusion. She uses this example as a jumping off point as to how we can start reconsidering our relationship to large scale infrastructure.

She goes on to explain how mapping infrastructure can dramatically inform how we design cities, manage resources, and network with each other. She cites Lisa Parks in saying that "it is our duty to be aware of systems that surround us." I think this is extremely important and typically goes unnoticed.

Despite some criticism to how some art projects may not yield any real answers to the problems they seek to expose, Mattern explains that these projects can cause people to be more self-reflexive, which could lead to large scale changes as a population.

*Week 3 Reading Response*
*Elkins, James, How to Look at a Culvert*

"A culvert is a lovely kind of thing because it is so utterly ignored. We donâ€™t notice them, but they are rich with information; they are mute records of the changes that civilization has brought to the landscape."

Elkin's quote above I think perfectly sums up his research on the culvert. He describes in detail through mathematics, formulas, and figures just how precise engineers have to be when calculating and building these structures. He also mentions just how quickly we can see the effects of hastily constructed infrastructure in America.

He goes on to mention that they provide a closer look in to the landscapes they inhabit. Something that is not as common now that many rivers are hidden underground. 


*Week 4 Reading Response*
*Ursula, Franklin. Real World of Technology. (1989). Chapter 1*

Ursula Franklin explains that technology is a system that entails far more than the sum of its parts. She states that "technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." She explains that over time technology muddles or sometimes destroys what has become a traditional social compass. She argues that global reformation is necessary in order to obtain some sense of security while at odds with wide-scale technological progression. She goes on to mention the difference between holistic and prescriptive technologies by using Chinese bronze-casting and the assembly line as examples.

I found just this first chapter extremely captivating. She finds a way of talking about such a large and general idea and breaking it down in to specific examples where context becomes apparent. I think it is very interesting that she wrote this in 1989. Just in the past decade we have seen some many emergent technologies shape how individuals are "supposed" to act in society all while shifting what is acceptable.
