The guy who's name I couldn't remember today, who related Norbert Wiener's ideas to art, was Jack Burnham. Here's a great article about him, written by Simon Penny who is a figure worth looking into on his own:

So, after re-visiting some of the stuff we talked about today...

Norbert Wiener's big contributions to electronic systems had to do with feedback. If I remember correctly, you used a guitar to demo your rpi effects processor last year so I'm going to assume that you're familiar with guitar feedback. If a guitar player wants feedback, they'll look for the sweet spot where the vibrations from the amplifier produce vibrations in a string on the guitar. This will produce a feedback loop where the vibrating guitar string is going to produce the exact tone needed from the amplifier to make the string continue to vibrate. The feedback loop gravitates towards perfect equilibrium but a perfect feedback loop on a guitar and amp gets boring so you need to introduce slight variations (noise) to make it interesting but not so much that it will interrupt the feedback loop. So the guitar player will bend the string. It briefly interrupts the feedback loop but does so in a way that the system can easily return to the note that produces the feedback loop. Does this make sense? If we apply the same concepts to the experiment I mentioned about having the computer alternately perform text to speech and then speech to text recognition, this would ultimately end up in a feedback loop where we would get the same alternating result. That's the nature of automated systems. That's Norbert Wiener's cybernetics. To avoid it, you need to introduce "noise", something that momentarily disrupts the system. But we can control that disruption by the degree of noise introduced. In the case of the guitar, we can slightly bend the string and then return to the feedback loop or we could switch to an entirely different note and bring the feedback loop to an abrupt halt.

Things to think about while researching "noise".

If you're going to talk about noise and associate it in any way with sound or music, you need to be aware of Glen Branca.
